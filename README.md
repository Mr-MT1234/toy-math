# Math library for graphics

This project aimed to make a math library to be used in a game engin. It was an opportunity to learn about template programming in C++.
It provides implementations for vectors and matricies that can support any datatype and any size without heap allocations thanks to templates.
It does not provide SIMD optimizations.
